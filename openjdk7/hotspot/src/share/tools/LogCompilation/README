This is a very rough tool for parsing -XX:+LogCompilation output.
It's main purpose is to recreate output similar to
-XX:+PrintCompilation -XX:+PrintInlining output from a debug JVM.  It
requires a 1.5 JDK to build and simply typing make should build it.

It produces a jar file, logc.jar, that can be run on the
hotspot.log from LogCompilation output like this:

  java -jar logc.jar hotspot.log

This will produce something like the normal PrintCompilation output.
Adding the -i option with also report inlining like PrintInlining.
