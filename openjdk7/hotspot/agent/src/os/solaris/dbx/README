The above files are captured from the dbx build environment.
Rather then use a -I that points to stuff in .eng domain that
may not be accessible in other domains these files are just
copied here so local builds in other domains will work.
These files rarely change so the fact that we might have to
strobe in new ones on rare occasions is no big deal.
