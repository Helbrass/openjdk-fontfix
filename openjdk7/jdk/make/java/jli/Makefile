# On Windows, some executable objects need to be statically linked against
# the jli library.  Hence, we need both a standard library (archive) and
# an import library (associated with a dll).  These both usually have the
# extension .LIB, so they need to be placed in different directories.  The
# import library is build (as usual) in the $(OBJDIR) directory while the
# standard library is built in a "static" subdirectory.  The standard library
# is not delivered as part of the product, but is only needed as part of
# the build process.  The import library is built by the standard rules
# in Library.gmk.  The additional rules which follow build the standard
# library.
