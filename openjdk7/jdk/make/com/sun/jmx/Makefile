# Makefile for building RMI stubs of JMX Remote

# NO java files to compile: already compiled in javax/management/Makefile

# Note : some targets are double colon rules and some single colon rules
# within common included gmk files : that is why the following for loop
# has been duplicated.

# When building the openjdk, no snmp
ifndef OPENJDK
