# Makefile for building sunec.jar and sunec native library.
#
# This file was derived from make/com/sun/crypto/provider/Makefile.
#

#
# (The terms "OpenJDK" and "JDK" below refer to OpenJDK and Sun JDK builds
# respectively.)
#
# JCE builds are very different between OpenJDK and JDK.  The OpenJDK JCE
# jar files do not require signing, but those for JDK do.  If an unsigned
# jar file is installed into JDK, things will break when the crypto
# routines are called.
#
# This Makefile does the "real" build of the JCE files.  For OpenJDK,
# the jar files built here are installed directly into the OpenJDK.
#
# For JDK, the binaries use pre-built/pre-signed binary files stored in
# the closed workspace that are not shipped in the OpenJDK workspaces.
# We still build the JDK files here to verify the files compile, and in
# preparation for possible signing.  Developers working on JCE in JDK
# must sign the JCE files before testing.  The JCE signing key is kept
# separate from the JDK workspace to prevent its disclosure.
#
# SPECIAL NOTE TO JCE/JDK developers:  The source files must eventually
# be built, signed, and then the resulting jar files MUST BE CHECKED
# INTO THE CLOSED PART OF THE WORKSPACE*.  This separate step *MUST NOT
# BE FORGOTTEN*, otherwise a bug fixed in the source code will not be
# reflected in the shipped binaries.  The "release" target should be
# used to generate the required files.
#
# There are a number of targets to help both JDK/OpenJDK developers.
#
# Main Targets (JDK/OPENJDK):
#
#     all/clobber/clean		The usual, plus the native libraries.
#				    If OpenJDK, installs sunec.jar.
#				    If JDK, installs prebuilt
#				    sunec.jar.
#
#     jar			Builds/installs sunec.jar
#				    If OpenJDK, does not sign.
#				    If JDK, tries to sign.
#
# Other lesser-used Targets (JDK/OPENJDK):
#
#     build-jar			Builds sunec.jar
#				    (does not sign/install)
#
#     install-jar		Alias for "jar" above.
#
# Other targets (JDK only):
#
#     sign			Alias for sign-jar
#	  sign-jar		Builds/signs sunec.jar (no install)
#
#     release			Builds all targets in preparation
#				for workspace integration.
#
#     install-prebuilt		Installs the pre-built jar files
#
# This makefile was written to support parallel target execution.
