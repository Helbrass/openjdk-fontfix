.LP
The \f3appletviewer\fP command connects to the documents or resources designated by \f2urls\fP and displays each applet referenced by the documents in its own window. Note: if the documents referred to by \f2urls\fP do not reference any applets with the \f2OBJECT\fP, \f2EMBED\fP, or \f2APPLET\fP tag, then \f3appletviewer\fP does nothing. For details on the HTML tags that \f3appletviewer\fP supports, see

\-Jjavaoption
