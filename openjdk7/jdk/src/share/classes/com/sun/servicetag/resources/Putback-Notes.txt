README for auto-generating of the offline registration page.

1. register.html is defined by the xDesign team.

2. Before putback in the workspace, we need to modify the 
   register.html to contain the following:

   (a) replace the pathname of the jdk_header.png image to
       <img src="@@JDK_HEADER_PNG@@" ....>

   (b) replace the product name from:
           Java Development Kit Version 6 Update 5 (e.g.)
       to:
           Java Development Kit @@JDK_VERSION@@ 

   (c) replace the form action for the "Register My JDK" button with:

       <form name="form1" method="post" action="@@REGISTRATION_URL@@" enctype="text/xml">

   (d) Add this input in the form for posting data after 
       the <form name=....> line:
 
       <input type="hidden" name="servicetag_payload" value="@@REGISTRATION_PAYLOAD@@">

3. The jdk_header.png is located under <JRE>/lib/servicetag directory.
