    /**
     * Produces an instance of the given single-method interface which redirects
     * its calls to the given method handle.
     * <p>
     * A single-method interface is an interface which declares a uniquely named method.
     * When determining the uniquely named method of a single-method interface,
     * the public {@code Object} methods ({@code toString}, {@code equals}, {@code hashCode})
     * are disregarded.  For example, {@link java.util.Comparator} is a single-method interface,
     * even though it re-declares the {@code Object.equals} method.
     * <p>
     * The interface must be public.  No additional access checks are performed.
     * <p>
     * The resulting instance of the required type will respond to
     * invocation of the type's uniquely named method by calling
     * the given target on the incoming arguments,
     * and returning or throwing whatever the target
     * returns or throws.  The invocation will be as if by
     * {@code target.invoke}.
     * The target's type will be checked before the
     * instance is created, as if by a call to {@code asType},
     * which may result in a {@code WrongMethodTypeException}.
     * <p>
     * The uniquely named method is allowed to be multiply declared,
     * with distinct type descriptors.  (E.g., it can be overloaded,
     * or can possess bridge methods.)  All such declarations are
     * connected directly to the target method handle.
     * Argument and return types are adjusted by {@code asType}
     * for each individual declaration.
     * <p>
     * The wrapper instance will implement the requested interface
     * and its super-types, but no other single-method interfaces.
     * This means that the instance will not unexpectedly
     * pass an {@code instanceof} test for any unrequested type.
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <em>Implementation Note:</em>
     * Therefore, each instance must implement a unique single-method interface.
     * Implementations may not bundle together
     * multiple single-method interfaces onto single implementation classes
     * in the style of {@link java.awt.AWTEventMulticaster}.
     * <p>
     * The method handle may throw an <em>undeclared exception</em>,
     * which means any checked exception (or other checked throwable)
     * not declared by the requested type's single abstract method.
     * If this happens, the throwable will be wrapped in an instance of
     * {@link java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException UndeclaredThrowableException}
     * and thrown in that wrapped form.
     * <p>
     * Like {@link java.lang.Integer#valueOf Integer.valueOf},
     * {@code asInterfaceInstance} is a factory method whose results are defined
     * by their behavior.
     * It is not guaranteed to return a new instance for every call.
     * <p>
     * Because of the possibility of {@linkplain java.lang.reflect.Method#isBridge bridge methods}
     * and other corner cases, the interface may also have several abstract methods
     * with the same name but having distinct descriptors (types of returns and parameters).
     * In this case, all the methods are bound in common to the one given target.
     * The type check and effective {@code asType} conversion is applied to each
     * method type descriptor, and all abstract methods are bound to the target in common.
     * Beyond this type check, no further checks are made to determine that the
     * abstract methods are related in any way.
     * <p>
     * Future versions of this API may accept additional types,
     * such as abstract classes with single abstract methods.
     * Future versions of this API may also equip wrapper instances
     * with one or more additional public "marker" interfaces.
     *
     * @param target the method handle to invoke from the wrapper
     * @param intfc the desired type of the wrapper, a single-method interface
     * @return a correctly-typed wrapper for the given target
     * @throws NullPointerException if either argument is null
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the {@code intfc} is not a
     *         valid argument to this method
     * @throws WrongMethodTypeException if the target cannot
     *         be converted to the type required by the requested interface
     */
    // Other notes to implementors:
    // <p>
    // No stable mapping is promised between the single-method interface and
    // the implementation class C.  Over time, several implementation
    // classes might be used for the same type.
    // <p>
    // If the implementation is able
    // to prove that a wrapper of the required type
    // has already been created for a given
    // method handle, or for another method handle with the
    // same behavior, the implementation may return that wrapper in place of
    // a new wrapper.
    // <p>
    // This method is designed to apply to common use cases
    // where a single method handle must interoperate with
    // an interface that implements a function-like
    // API.  Additional variations, such as single-abstract-method classes with
    // private constructors, or interfaces with multiple but related
    // entry points, must be covered by hand-written or automatically
    // generated adapter classes.
